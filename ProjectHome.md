a web ansi editor in javascript, using canvas/ajax/etc technology.


_warning: this is just a quick and dirty proof of concept._

the whole source code will be cleaned up in the near future.

**watch it in use at: http://ansi.drastic.net/**


the source code contains only the client side of the editor.

no web server is required to try it out/experiment with, just open the index.html in a browser.
